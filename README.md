# RoboMaster_Planning_Node

This is the first draft of RoboMaster Planning Node implementation.

Basic communication between nodes is realized under the ROS topic (publisher-subscriber) structure.

The effectiveness can be verified by running the four nodes: 

*** planning_node
*** velocity_subscriber
*** pose_publisher
*** target)publisher
